PointCloud SDK Sample Project

README

This is a PointCloud SDK Sample Project. It shows the basic usage of the PointCloud SDK like:
- Creating an instance of the SDK using an application key

- Initializing and creating a SLAM map

- Tracking a SLAM map

- Displaying content in OpenGL ES 1.1 relative to reality using the camera pose

- Detecting and tracking image targets

- Demonstrating proper display of the PointCloud logo according to the branding guidelines (http://developer.pointcloud.io/sdk/guidelines)

For more info on PointCloud SDK or the PointCloud Browser, take a look at http://developer.pointcloud.io.

NOTES

- PointCloud SDK for iOS requires that you link your application to the Accelerate framework

- SLAM is not optimized for single core devices like the iPhone 3GS or the iPhone 4, and is not recommended on these devices.

- When initializing a SLAM map, make sure to move the device slowly left/right, up/down, in/out. 
Aim the camera at a scene with lots of visual detail and which is not too far away (you'll need to move the camera much farther if the scene is far away).

- The SLAM map will continually expand when you move the camera around (if you don't move too fast).

- The image detection example looks for the images image_target_1.jpg and image_target_2.jpg, which you'll find under Resources.
View these on your computer, or print them out to try the image detection example.

- FPS in this sample project is set to 30 for the iPad2 and iPhone4S and at 15 for the 3GS and 4. 
This is because image detection performance is improved with lower framerates (the CPU gets more time to analyze the image when the overhead of processing frames is lowered).
